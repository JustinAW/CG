Q1:
    Slices are divisions around the z axis; latitudinal divisions.

Q2:
    Stacks are divisions along the z axis: longitudinal divisions.

Q3:
    The sphere's center is on the origin, aka it extends an equal distance
    (the radius) from the origin in every direction.

Q4:
    Doing either results in the sphere disappearing entirely.

Q5:
    It's hard to say with such a small sphere, but presumably, no.

Q6:
    The practical limit to the number of slices or stacks is one which the
    sphere stops looking like a wire sphere and starts to look like a solid
    sphere.

Q7:
    This limit is different for every sphere that has a different radius.
    The limit would be higher the larger the radius a sphere has due to the
    fact that larger radius spheres have a larger surface area and therefore
    the distance between each 'wire' becomes greater. According to the formula
    for the perimeter of a circle, C = 2PIr, C becomes greater as r increases.
    When C becomes larger, dividing it by the same number produces larger 
    results. The result of dividing C by a number gives you the distance
    between each division in the wire sphere, whether it be a slice or a stack.

Q8:
    No, it does nothing.

Q9:
    It looks like a flat polygon.

Q10:
    Same as Q1

Q11:
    Same as Q2

Q12:
    The cone base is at the origin, and the tip is on the z axis.

Q13:
    nsides is how many sides each ring has, therefore it is oriented around
    each ring

Q14:
    The rings are oriented perpendicular to the z axis where looking along
    the z axis results in only being able to see the rings as lines

Q15:
    The torus wraps around the z axis with the center at the origin.

Q16:
    No, but that wouldn't make much sense. It's a cube.

Q17:
    It's oriented such that every edge is both perpendicular and parallel to
    2 different of the axes. The center of the cube is at the origin.

Q18:
    The dodecahedron is centered at the origin, and when looking from the
    perspective that has z coming toward you, the perimeter forms a hexagon
    and that hexagon is oriented with the x axis being perpendicular to the 
    faces and the y axis lining up with the corners. If looking down the x
    axis, it is opposite where y is perpendicular to the faces, and z is
    aligned with the corners.

Q19:
    1.0

Q20:
    No, it looks the same.

Q21:
    Yes, it makes the sphere disappear.

Q22:
    No, it just changed the vertices to points as I suspected.

Q23:
    Nope, it filled it.

Q24:
    Nothing, but this is because there are no coplanar edges on a sphere.
    If there were coplanar edges, it would not draw them.

Q25:
