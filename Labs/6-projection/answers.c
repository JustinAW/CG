Q2:
    The image gets smaller each added distance, but it is less distorted. This
    is due to the fact that the camera is getting farther away from the pillar.
    As the camera gets farther, the fact that we can see the entire pillar at
    any distance becomes less and less impactful on the perceived vertical fov.

Q4:
    The values I used were -5.0, 5.0, -5.0, 5.0
 
Q5:
    This image appears much more realistic than the images from Q2.
