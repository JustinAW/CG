Q1:
    Setting both EYE_LINEAR and x + y + z = 0 results in the original vertical
    magenta lines becoming curved. The curves are relative to the eye, or in
    other terms, it is perpendicular to the base of the window regardless of
    how the teapot oriented. This means that rotating the teapot, the curves
    do not move.

Q2:
    x = 0 results in the original image when running the program where the
    magenta lines on the teapot are all vertical no matter the orientation
    of the teapot. The lines do not move when the teapot moves, just as in
    q1.

Q3:
    This appears no different from q1 initially, but if the teapot is rotated,
    the curved lines stay relative to the teapot, not the eye/window. They move
    with the teapot.

Q4:
    This results in the lines staying perpendicular to the base of the teapot.
    Just like q3, the lines move with the teapot.


Q5:
