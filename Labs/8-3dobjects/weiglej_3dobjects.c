Q1:
    Slices are divisions around the z axis; latitudinal divisions.

Q2:
    Stacks are divisions along the z axis: longitudinal divisions.

Q3:
    The sphere's center is on the origin, aka it extends an equal distance
    (the radius) from the origin in every direction.

Q4:
    Doing either results in the sphere disappearing entirely.

Q5:
    It's hard to say with such a small sphere, but presumably, no.

Q6:
    The practical limit to the number of slices or stacks is one which the
    sphere stops looking like a wire sphere and starts to look like a solid
    sphere.

Q7:
    This limit is different for every sphere that has a different radius.
    The limit would be higher the larger the radius a sphere has due to the
    fact that larger radius spheres have a larger surface area and therefore
    the distance between each 'wire' becomes greater. According to the formula
    for the perimeter of a circle, C = 2PIr, C becomes greater as r increases.
    When C becomes larger, dividing it by the same number produces larger 
    results. The result of dividing C by a number gives you the distance
    between each division in the wire sphere, whether it be a slice or a stack.
