Q1:     It has no effect on the size of the image because the smallest size
        that can be rendered is 1 pixel

Q2:     GL_LINES
            When 2 vertices are provided for GL_LINES it creates a line between
            those two points, and when 4 are provided it just creates lines
            between first and second point and between the third and fourth
            point but not between the second and third.
        GL_LINE_STRIP
            GL_LINE_STRIP, unlike GL_LINES, connects each new vertex added to
            the previous one. It does not connect the last one declared to the
            first, however.
        GL_LINE_LOOP
            GL_LINE_STRIP works like GL_LINE_STRIP, but it also connects the
            last vertex back to the first.

Q3:     When an odd number of vertices is provided to GL_LINES it draws nothing
        for the final vertex 

Q4:
