Q1:
    Translate appears first
Q2:
    Translate is applied first
Q3:
    No, the triangle appears in the center with the translate first and at the
    side with rotate first. This is due to the face that when translated first,
    the triangle starts the rotation out to the right where it was translated
    to. But when it is rotated first, it just translates upwards.
Q4:
    No, scaling first leads to the triangle being moved farther. Translating
    first and then scaling moves the triangle the expected amount and then
    scales it.
Q5:
    No, scaling first makes it rotate farther
Q6:
    Same as Q5, scaling first makes it rotate farther


Q7:
